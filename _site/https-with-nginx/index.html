I took pride in my work and respected his opinion, so when he did the rewrite, I had to understand why. We sat down, had a discussion and to this day, I will always remember what he said:  … write code like its a story … Now, at first I didn’t quite understand what it meant so I had to find my own meaning. Introduction: The introduction in a story normally involves introducing the scene, setting the environment, characters and any other parties involved. In code, this is usually where you would initialize variables, import required libraries, preprocess data or build the base structure that is required. A glance at the first few lines should explain the entire method. Middle: The information that is prepared in the introduction would be processed in this section. Normally in a story, there would be twists and turns but when writing code, this would be something that we would avoid. Conclusion: The conlusion in a story would wrap a story up, providing a satisfying result and setting the emotions of the reader. This is where you would wrap up the function, finalizing any information that needs to be returnedto the consumer which may involve building the expected structure. SummaryWriting code like a story isn’t something that should applied to everything. Each language has its own quirksand correct way, so follow the best standards. We should strive to avoid unexpected twists and turns as a developer. "

Problem At Hand: Solving the problem should be the main priority. Sometimes, it is okay to write ‘messy’ code. Especially when it comes to prototyping as this a conceptual phase, where we are testing whether its acheivable. But keep in mind if its done this way, the codebase must be thrown out for a rewrite at some point to a proper structure with proper abstraction. Code Duplication: Code duplication is okay when complexity for a part of the codebase is higher than it should be. This can usually be seen when there are too many conditionals within a block of code. In this case, seperating the section that we want to change to seperate blocks is the best approach, because the new section is now scene as a seperate piece of logic. "

    "body": "2018/03/01 - Our task was to create a module that could import users into the database. Keep in mind, all the challenges that we had for the required features were tackled as they came up. We were new to Drupal and many of the tools that we were going to use, so we couldn’t really foresee any problems that came up. This guide also assumes that basic knowledge of how to create a plugin in Drupal 7 and the usage of a few other tools mentioned above is already known. GoalsThe goals that was laid out at the start was to:  Use an existing import module Import the users without using the internal cron system Utilize a seperate storage system for reliability and speed Process the queueing independantly Log any errorsExisting Import Module: Was required because we were already using an import tool, which did the job but not fast enough. Cron System: It ran through the cron system which imported around 100 users per minute and ran on each web page load. Seperate Storage: We wanted to use a seperate storage because it would function faster if we stored the job in memory. A relational database was too slow. Process Indepedantly: The cron system worked on each request. We wanted to import a large number of users so we needed speed. Log: If a user could not be imported, we wanted it to reliably log where it stopped and why. Losing data was not an option because the data being inserted was too large to sit down and check by eye. EmailFirst off, we needed a queueing system to be adding into the project that would allow any email sent to be redirected to a queue. The hard part about this was integrating it into Drupal in a way that would allow the traditional way of sending emails as an option because we wanted to slowly integrate it into the system. This meant that we needed an on/off where the user could change how emails could be processed. By approaching this problem first, we would be able to integrate another feature into the queueing system in the future. I picked Resque to be used after a bit of research because we already had a Redis server running for sessions. By using Redis to store the queue jobs, it would be fast and that data we stored there was independant of the database. Setup Redis: Any redis server would work as long as we had the correct url, username and password. For this project, we used Docker containers edis:3. 2-alpine and eldadfux/resque-web. Create the Generic Module: Download and add the plugin into the module folder under lib. Make sure the library is loaded into Drupal’s caching system: {% highlight php %} function my_resque_libraries_info() { $libraries['resque'] = array(  'name' =&gt; 'PHP Resque',  'vendor url' =&gt; '',  'download url' =&gt; '',  'path' =&gt; 'vendor',  'version' =&gt; 1,  'files' =&gt; array(    'php' =&gt; array('autoload. php'),  ),);return $libraries;} {% endhighlight %} Create 2 function that would give the user the ability to save the mailsystem where the mail will actually be processed. The 3 step process for how it would look like when a mail is queued will look like this mailsystem &gt; queue &gt; custom_mailsystem &gt; mail_processor. Mail processor will be Mailgun for example. {% highlight php %} function my_resque_mailsystem_form_alter(&amp;$form, &amp;$form_state, $form_id) { . . . $html_select = '&lt;select name=' . $key . '-' . $module . '-class' . ' class= form-select &gt;';  foreach (mailsystem_get_classes() as $class) {    // Prevent infinite loop to self.     if ($class == 'myResqueMailSystem') continue;    $html_select . = '&lt;option value= ' . $class . ' ';      $html_select . = (isset($settings[$module]['class']) &amp;&amp; $settings[$module]['class'] == $class) ? 'selected' : '';    $html_select . = '&gt;' . $class . '&lt;/option&gt;';  }$html_select . = '&lt;/select&gt;';. . . } function my_resque_mailsystem_form_submit($form, &amp;$form_state) { . . . if (isset($form_state['values'])) {  $inputs = $form_state['input'];  foreach (mailsystem_get() as $module =&gt; $mailsystem) {    if (isset($inputs[$key . '-' . $module . '-class'])) {      $settings[$module]['class'] = $inputs[$key . '-' . $module . '-class'];    } else {      $settings[$module]['class'] = 'DefaultMailSystem';    }    // Save some other mailsystems that may be related.   }}. . . } {% endhighlight %} Create a generic function where all sub modules will call to add a job to the queue. {% highlight php %} function my_resque_queue($module, $class, $variables = array()) { // Check if the library is laoded. $library = libraries_detect('resque'); // Lets load it if its not loaded. if (empty($library['loaded'])) {  cache_clear_all('resque', 'cache_libraries');  drupal_static_reset('libraries_load');  libraries_load('resque');}// Get any variables$key = 'my';$redis_host     = variable_get($key . '_host', 'redis'); // redis because we're using docker named network containers$redis_port     = variable_get($key . '_port', '6379');$redis_password   = variable_get($key . '_password', '');$redis_table    = variable_get($key . '_table', 1);// Connectif (strlen($redis_password) == null) {  Resque::setBackend($redis_host . ':' . $redis_port . '/' . $redis_table);} else {  Resque::setBackend('redis://redis:' . $redis_password . '@' . $redis_host . ':' . $redis_port . '/' . $redis_table);}$token = Resque::enqueue($module, $class, $variables, false);return array('token' =&gt; $token);} {% endhighlight %} Whats happening here is, the function will load the Resque library that was included above, get all the variables that we have saved. It will the enqueue the job and return the token id of the job. If this function is called succesfully, a job should now appear in Redis. Create a Mail Mailsytem: Create a new submodule to with the functionality to create a new mailsystem called MyResqueMailSystem, which is a class that implements MailSystemInterface in a file called my_resque_mailsystem. mail. inc. {% highlight php %} class MyResqueMailSystem implements MailSystemInterface { private function template(&amp;$message) {  . . . }public function format(array $message) {    . . . } }{% endhighlight %} This module relies on the mailsystem module which allows the user to define custom mailing be used, in this case, we wanted all mail to be sent to the queue instead of directly sending to Mailgun. The queue would then process the job when the time comes and send the mail using Mailgun. The trickiest part about this was getting the redirect to work properly. Inside the mailsytem class, the format function had the ability to redirect to the right custom mailsystem, which was saved using the form my_resque_mailsystem_form_alter() {} and my_resque_mailsystem_form_submit() {} {% highlight php %} public function format(array $message) { . . . $settings    = variable_get($key);$instances   = &amp;drupal_static(__FUNCTION__, array());$class = null;if (isset($settings[$message['module']])) {  $class = $settings[$message['module']]['class'];} else {  $class = $settings['default-system']['class'];}if (empty($instances[$class])) {  $interfaces = class_implements($class);  if (isset($interfaces['MailSystemInterface'])) {    $instances[$class] = new $class();  } else {    throw new Exception(strtr('Class %class does not implement interface %interface', [      '%class' =&gt; $class, '%interface' =&gt; 'MailSystemInterface'    ]));  }}. . . } {% endhighlight %} Create The Worker: …// stuff "

Step 2 - Implement the Controller: {% highlight js %} ({  doInit : function(component, event) {    var action = component. get(“c. findAll”);   action. setCallback(this, function(a) {    component. set( v. contacts , a. getReturnValue());  });  $A. enqueueAction(action);} }){% endhighlight %} Step 3 - Add the component to a page: {% highlight html %}   {% endhighlight %} Notes:  c. is the default namespace for Lightning componentsPart 4Now that we decided to build SearchBar and ContactList as two separate components, we need a way for ContactList to know when the search key changes so that it can retrieve and display the matching contacts. Lightning Events enable that kind of communication between components. In this step, you create a Lightning Event used by the SearchBar component to notify other components when the search key changes. Step 1 - Create an event:    File &gt; New &gt; Lightning Event     Implement the component as follows:  {% highlight html %}   {% endhighlight %} Step 2 - Create a SearchBar component:    File &gt; New &gt; Lightning Component     Implement the component as follows:  {% highlight html %}   {% endhighlight %} Step 3 - Implement the Controller: {% highlight js %} ({  searchKeyChange: function(component, event, helper) {    var myEvent = $A. get(“e. c:SearchKeyChange”);    myEvent. setParams({“searchKey”: event. target. value});    myEvent. fire();  }}) {% endhighlight %} Notes:  Gets an instance of the SearchKeyChange eventStep 4 - Listen for the SearchKeyChange Event in ConsignmentList:  Go back to the ConsignmentList component.  Add the following to the existing code:{% highlight html %} {% endhighlight %}  In the controller, add the following below onInit:{% highlight js %} searchKeyChange: function(component, event) {  var searchKey = event. getParam(“searchKey”);  var action = component. get(“c. findByName”); action. setParams({  searchKey : searchKey});action. setCallback(this, function(a) {  component. set( v. contacts , a. getReturnValue());});$A. enqueueAction(action); }{% endhighlight %} Step 5 - Finish Off Add &lt;c:SearchBar/&gt; and &lt;c:ContactList/&gt; to any page to retreive and display the component. {% highlight html %}     {% endhighlight %} "

By doing so, we can nowallow the entire repo to be cloned onto the server everytime we make a push to the desired branch (preferably master) in the deployment pipeline. More commands can be added such as composer install or apt-get update but we mustssh in with ssh root@123. 123. 123. 123, to allow more automation. Another option is to create a script file and run that script file instead. After it is all set up, we can now deploy to the server after every push rather using a filemanager to manually copy over files or ssh into the server to run git pull. Certain hookscan be added into the pipeline and tests can also be ran for each push to master. Codeship is one of many continous deployment applications out there. "

			<blockquote>
  <p>Is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the following link <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04"><strong>How To Secure Nginx with Let’s Encrypt</strong></a>,
any website in the domain can now be secured where all connections between to the server will be 
encrypted.</p>

<p>After installing <code class="highlighter-rouge">certbot-auto</code>, we can now secure any domain or subdomain.</p>

<p>First we must allow certbot to access and create a file by adding in</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-nginx" data-lang="nginx"><span class="k">location</span> <span class="p">~</span> <span class="sr">/.well-known</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kn">allow</span> <span class="s">all</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For a proxy pass/port forward, we need to create an alias instead</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-nginx" data-lang="nginx"><span class="k">location</span> <span class="n">/.well-known</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kn">alias</span> <span class="n">/var/www/blog.tuanb.me/.well-known</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, we use the following command to create a certificate.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-nginx" data-lang="nginx"><span class="k">certbot-auto</span> <span class="s">certonly</span> <span class="s">-a</span> <span class="s">webroot</span> <span class="s">--webroot-path=/var/www/blog.tuanb.me/_site</span> <span class="s">-d</span> <span class="s">blog.tuanb.me</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will need to edit the nginx domain config inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/blog.tuanb.me</code>, 
remove port 80 access and add in the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-nginx" data-lang="nginx"><span class="k">server</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kn">...</span>
    
    <span class="s">listen</span> <span class="mi">443</span> <span class="s">ssl</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="kn">server_name</span> <span class="s">blog.tuanb.me</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="kn">ssl_certificate</span> <span class="n">/etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.tuanb.me/fullchain.pem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kn">ssl_certificate_key</span> <span class="n">/etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.tuanb.me/privkey.pem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kn">include</span> <span class="s">conf.s/ssl</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">server</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kn">listen</span> <span class="mi">80</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kn">server_name</span> <span class="s">blog.tuanb.me</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kn">return</span> <span class="mi">301</span> <span class="s">https://</span><span class="nv">$host$request_uri</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">conf.s/ssl</code> is the ssl extra configurations</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-nginx" data-lang="nginx"><span class="k">ssl_protocols</span> <span class="s">TLSv1</span> <span class="s">TLSv1.1</span> <span class="s">TLSv1.2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">ssl_prefer_server_ciphers</span> <span class="no">on</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">ssl_dhparam</span> <span class="n">/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">ssl_ciphers</span> <span class="s">[the</span> <span class="s">cipher]</span>
<span class="s">ssl_session_timeout</span> <span class="s">1d</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">ssl_session_cache</span> <span class="s">shared:SSL:50m</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">ssl_stapling</span> <span class="no">on</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">ssl_stapling_verify</span> <span class="no">on</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">add_header</span> <span class="s">Strict-Transport-Security</span> <span class="s">max-age=15768000</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The steps will be needed to be replicated for each subdomain and will only take a few minutes.</p>
