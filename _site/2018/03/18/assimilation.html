Especially when you’re really caught up in it.</p><blockquote><p>Shorter cycles of research, reading, and knowledge assimilation are better than long ones. With every full cycle from research to knowledge assimilation, we learn more about the topic.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">The Collector’s Fallacy by Christian</a></p><p>For a year, I completely stopped consuming information and learning. Upon returning home, I felt so behind and lacking in so many areas. To counter this, I tried to absorb as much as possible in a short amount of time. Long story short, it didn’t quite work out.</p><p>Instead, I’ve decided to try take in small bits of information on a daily basis.</p><p>This blog will be the main way for me to write and take notes about it, understand it in my own way.</p><p>It won’t become a daily blog, because that would defeat the purpose and go agaist what Christian’s post talks about. A post will be written only when I feel its so important, that I need to write it down to look back on.</p><hr class="divider"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//tuanb-me.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript> </article></main><footer><div class="links"> <a href="https://blog.tuanb.me/contact/">Contact</a> <a class="theme" onclick="theme()">Dark/Light</a></div></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ga-lite@1/dist/ga-lite.min.js" async></script><script> var galite = galite || {}; galite.UA = 'UA-90397102-1';</script></body></html>
