Each project requires a seperate key attachment as they point to different folders on the server.</p><p>In Codeship, select a custom script deployment and add the following line <code class="highlighter-rouge">scp -rp ~/clone/* root@123.456.789.0:/var/www/blog.tuanb.me/</code>. By doing so, we can now allow the entire repo to be cloned onto the server everytime we make a push to the desired branch (preferably <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>) in the deployment pipeline.</p><p>More commands can be added such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">composer install</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get update</code> but we must ssh in with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh root@123.123.123.123</code>, to allow more automation. Another option is to create a script file and run that script file instead.</p><p>After it is all set up, we can now deploy to the server after every push rather using a file manager to manually copy over files or ssh into the server to run git pull. Certain hooks can be added into the pipeline and tests can also be ran for each push to master.</p><p>Codeship is one of many continous deployment applications out there.</p><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//tuanb-me.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><footer><div class="links"> <a href="/contact/">Contact</a></div><div class="theme" onclick="theme()" style=" background-image: url(/images/theme.svg)"></div></footer><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-90397102-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
