title: Understand and Comprehend
---

The web world is too large to consume and remember each and every detail. The best way to fully absorb it is to understand and comprehend the idea, rather than remembering what information was about.

> Shorter cycles of research, reading, and knowledge assimilation are better than long ones. With every full cycle from research to knowledge assimilation, we learn more about the topic.

[The Collectorâ€™s Fallacy by Christian](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/)

Repetition is better than trying to absorb everything at once. 

For a year, I completely stopped consuming information and learning. Upon my return, I felt so behind. To counter this, I tried to absorb as much as possible in a short amount of time. It didn't work.

The best way is to take in small bits of information and understand it. This blog will be the main way for me to write and take notes about it, understand it in my own way.

It won't become a daily blog, because that would defeat the purpose and go agaist what Christian's post talks about. A post will be written only when I feel its important.
