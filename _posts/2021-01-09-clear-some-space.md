Discovering that my `Projects` folder had around 50 projects and probably 50 `node_modules` sub directories, I installed [https://www.npmjs.com/package/npkill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npkill) and cleared up some space.

The script removed 3gb of files, which is quite alot considering 80% of those projects were last accessed 1-2 years ago.
