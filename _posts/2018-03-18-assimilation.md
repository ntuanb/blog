title: Assimilation

The web world is too large to consume and remember each and every detail. The best way to fully absorb it is to understand and comprehend the idea, rather than remembering what information was about. 

This statement may seem obvious but sometimes, sitting back and having a think about it can be helpful. Especially when you're really caught up in it.

[The Collectorâ€™s Fallacy by Christian](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/)

For a year, I completely stopped consuming information and learning. Upon returning home, I felt so behind and lacking in so many areas. To counter this, I tried to absorb as much as possible in a short amount of time. Long story short, it didn't quite work out.

Instead, I've decided to try take in small bits of information on a daily basis. 

This blog will be the main way for me to write and take notes about it, understand it in my own way.

It won't become a daily blog, because that would defeat the purpose and go agaist what Christian's post talks about. A post will be written only when I feel its so important, that I need to write it down to look back on.
