All year round, when the important day comes, I've always had to use the internet to search for some ideas on buying a gift for my mother for Mother's Day or for her birthday. She is known to be quite picky when it comes
to items so its always a tough decision.

Together with my sister, we've tried almost everything ranging from clothes to appliances. Here are some of 
the items we've found to be the most receptive in terms of happiness, with no complaints.

This post is a mix of truth and satire, so use it wisely!

### Money

As always, cold hard cash is the best gift, preferably in a nice envelope for a bit of a suprise.

### University Degree

If you're still in university, this is the best gift of all. It will take a few years but it will be 
worth it. Remember to take her to the ceremony and take plenty of photos, let her wear the cap instead
for extra smiles.

### Phone or Tablet

This one revolves around the idea that growing up, she would always be using previous generation
mobile phones that no one in the house would use anymore. It was her way of saving money.

# Flowers

Every now and then, we would forget to buy her a gift so a fresh bouquet of flowers purchased from a 
nearby flower shop makes a great gift.

### Heavily Discounted Item

Items from a flea market or heavily discounted is the best. Make sure to 
emphasize how lucky you were or how much energy you exerted bartering.

# Conclusion

Whatever the gift is, make sure its pragmatic.
