Twelve months of remote work across Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao has been a great life experience.

Would I do it again? Of course.

# Communication

### Daily Standups
We had meetings everyday at 10am where each member of the team would describe `What they worked on yeserday`, `What they want to achieve today` and `Blockers`. 

These were important as I could keep up to date with what was happening and ask questions I couldn't ask because of any timezone difference.

### Standuply
This didn't really work because no one read or kept up to date with what the other members typed in.

### Slack
The primary chat tool that we used with channels for specific projects. This was great because it also allowed fun tools such as `/giphy` and custom emojis, which were used to keep the connection with the team.

### Hangouts
Anytime a question or discussion was required, the best approach was a call.

# Motivation

### Atmosphere
Working at home for a week was bad for mentality and motivation. Visting the library or cafe once a day, especially after lunch kept things fresh.

### Routine
Keeping a consistant routine was important to not stress the body, escpecially because of the quick changes that occurred on a daily basis: weather, food etc.

# Accomodation
A good desk and internet is important.

# Energy

These were important:

- Slept on time
- Ate well and healthy, more when required because of the after work plans
- Took time off from travel when required, sometimes a day of doing nothing was good
- Did't need to go out everyday or weekend


# Loneliness

### People

### Hobbies

- Continue hobbies
- Talk to everyone
- dormitory or guesthouse
- Must enjoy time with yourself
- Long periods of time where won't meet many people
- Keep in contact with friends

### Romance

# Lessons

### Upskill
I stopped upskilling myself through out the trip. Upon returning after a year, I felt like I had
fallen behind. 

### Excercise
Excercise as often as you can.

The blog post was written mostly as bullet points it was quicker to jot down the key points. I might update it someday with more information for each part.
