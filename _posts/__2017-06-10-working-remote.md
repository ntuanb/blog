title: Travelling and Working
---

Twelve months of not knowing if it was possible to work remotely,
it finally happened in March of 2017 when it was officially approved by my company.

Three months in, so far it has been a great experience and worth the stress and constant nagging in
my mind of doing something out of my confort zone. 

Although it has been a good experience, there have been a few moments where I wondered if it was 
something I could do for an extended amount of time.

I lost count of the number of times expats and former expats told me that you can only really enjoy Korea when people can tell you or show you where to go. [http://www.bordersofadventure.com/why-i-didnt-love-south-korea-but-why-im-glad-i-gave-it-a-chance/]

# Love

Quote Falling in love when you travel can be one of the best things ever. You get to share some of the greatest experiences you will ever have with someone you care deeply about. You get to exist in a world separate from ‘the real world’, where early mornings, stresses and jobs don’t exist. With people you may never see again, in cultures completely foreign to you.

The bond of friendship and love forms differently to when you’re ‘back home’. Things that would normally take months to transpire at home take mere weeks. /Quote

On the other side, it can also be the worst feeling ever. 

I'm that kind of person that would take a leap of faith or not let luck be the deciding factor.
