Class is an object that must have implementation.

Abstract Class is an incomplete class that has some implementation, which is common among the classes that inherits it. An abstract class can also have variables defined to be used and inherited. An abstract class
also can not be instantitiated (used or methods called). It must be inherited in some way.

Interfaces cannot have any implementation. They are used as a template to define what methods a class should have when it implements this.
