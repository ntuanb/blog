I always believed I wrote well structured code but got a shock when a team member commented
on a piece of work I created, describing that it was hard to understand and did a complete rewrite. 

I took pride in my work and respected his opinion, so when he did the rewrite, I had to understand why. We sat down, had a discussion and to this day, I will always remember what he said:

> ... write code like its a story ...

Now, at first I didn't quite understand what it meant so I had to find my own meaning.

### Introduction

The introduction in a story normally involves introducing the scene, setting the environment, characters 
and any other parties involved.

In code, this is usually where you would initialize variables, import required libraries, preprocess data or build 
the base structure that is required.

A glance at the first few lines should explain the entire method.

### Middle

The information that is prepared in the introduction would be processed in this section. 

Normally in a story, there would be twists and turns but when writing code, this would be something 
that we would avoid.

### Conclusion

The conlusion in a story would wrap a story up, providing a satisfying result and setting the emotions of the reader. 

This is where you would wrap up the function, finalizing any information that needs to be returned
to the consumer which may involve building the expected structure.

# Summary

Writing code like a story isn't something that should applied to everything. Each language has its own quirks
and correct way, so follow the best standards.

We should strive to avoid unexpected twists and turns as a developer.
