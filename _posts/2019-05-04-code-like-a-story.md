I always thought I wrote well structured code but got a bit of a surprise when a co-worker described
a piece of code I was writing as hard to understand.

Respecting his constructive criticism, I had to understand why. To summarise the most important section
of the convsersion:

> ... write code like its a story ...

At first I didn't quite understand what it meant so I had to find my own meaning.

### Introduction

The introduction in a story normally involves introducing the scene, setting the environment, characters 
and any other parties involved.

In code, this is usually where you would initialize variables, import required libraries, preprocess data or build 
the base structure that is required.

A glance at the first few lines should explain the entire method.

### Middle

The information that is prepared in the introduction would be processed in this section. 

Normally in a story, there would be twists and turns but when writing code, this would be something 
that we would avoid.

### Conclusion

The conlusion in a story would wrap a story up, providing a satisfying result and setting the emotions of the reader. 

This is where you would wrap up the function, finalizing any information that needs to be returned
to the consumer which may involve building the expected structure.

# Summary

To summarise, I belive that writing code like is a story means as a developer, you must be able to 
structure and design your codebase so that anyone can easily dive in and contribute.
