title: Object Oriented Programming

# OOP

OOP or object oriented programming was always a concept I knew and though I
understood well enough to have the ability to use it well in all the projects I
have worked on.

### Beginning

Throughout the course of my 1st year of working in the industry since the end of 2014, I have mostly worked
with PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML using tools like Laravel, Wordpress, Bootstrap and SaSS.

The code that I wrote for these several projects were not that complex, as I found
myself using libraries a lot of the time, each of those providing just the right
amount of feature and complexity for my needs.

The simplicity made reading through existing code easy, knowing where to lookig and
what to change was straight forward.

### Now

Until recently.

I found myself looking through code in a project I was working on riddled with bugs
where it was easy to fix, but annoying enough to be annoyed at myself.

This project is written in JavaScript using Angular 1 inside Ionic 1.

I followed the Angular concepts as much as possible, using factories, controllers
and directives where required. But every now and then, I found myself not using those
recommended was and wrote a lot more parts in the controller than I should be.

### Changes

So now, I find myself having to rewrite parts of the old code to fix my previous
mistakes.

# Why

Some possible reasons why I believe am getting better at OOP:

### Better understanding of Angular and JavaScript

Better understanding of the way Angular works with the controllers, directives and
services/factories.

Using JavaScript for 8 hours a day forced me to use '===' a lot, similiar to [AirBnb
JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide.

### Seeing colleague's code and structure

Not only have I been working with Angular to create the mobile app, but also parts of the
API that goes along with it.

The API is a project another colleague is working on that I
had input on as time constraints allowed me to also spend time on it, and because
I needed specific ways data needed to be displayed in JSON.

My colleague is more experienced as he has worked on other projects before so seeing
the structure and coding style was a good opportunity. Everything was written in
small functions where required and followed a neat coding structure.

### Better Understanding of the Requirements

Having a good understanding of the project at the start is important as it allows
the plan to be made at the start, rather the during the project where things are
constantly changing.

### Annoyed

Being annoyed about my own code and fixing it forced me to write better code for newer
features of the project.

### Dealing with Promises and Async

So annoying so splitting each part up made it a lot easier.

### Objects

Use objects as much as possible for UI as adding new object parameters for animations
is easier.

# Conclusion

Getting better, I hope!

Also, I wrote this at 1am. Need to rewrite and fix grammar some day.
