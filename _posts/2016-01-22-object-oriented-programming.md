# OOP

OOP or object oriented programming is a concept that all programmers should know
and something I though I had a good understanding before I started working on a
new project.

### Beginning

My first year involved mainly PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML through tools such as
Laravel, Wordpress and Bootstrap, which meant a lot of the functionality was
already built.

Coding for these projects were mostly not complex but did involve a good understanding
of the requirements.

There were some projects that required a good understanding but those projects
didn't get big enough to launch and continue working on.

Therefore, I didn't really find myself in situations where I needed to use a lot
of complex structuring and coding.

### Cause

For the past couple of months, I have been working on a project that involved using
Angular and Ionic.

I followed the Angular structuring and guidelines as close as possible but found
myself often coding in just the controller as it was quicker.

At the same time, I also coded in a very procedural way. Where that specific section
would do a task from top to bottom, with a lot of if elses.

Each time a problem occurred, I would just add to the if else, causing big chunks of
code that would become a problem as I started to change certain parts.

Being in the situation where I had to start fixing the problem, I found myself being
annoyed at what I was looking at. At the same time, having to fix the problems too.

### Solution

Now, I find myself having to rewrite parts of the old code to fix my previous
mistakes.

In addition, spending that extra time planning out what I needed to do and refactoring
code wherever possible, even if it took that extra time.

# Why

Some reasons why I've decided to change things up:

### Better understanding of Angular and JavaScript

Better understanding of the way Angular works with the controllers, directives and
services/factories.

Using JavaScript for 8 hours a day and having my colleague give that weird look
each time he saw me use '==' instead of '===' forced me to write code in a more better way.

Using [AirBnb JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide is something
I need to look into more.

### Seeing colleague's code and structure

I have been working with Angular to create the mobile app with Ionic and also the
API that goes along with it.

The API is a project another colleague is in charge of but I have gotten the
opportunity to have input on as there were time constraints and on occasion,
defining the output data.

In addition, my colleague is more experienced as he has worked on other projects
using Angular and Node before so seeing the structure and coding style eye changing.
Everything was written in small functions where required and followed a neat structure.

Its something I still need to improve on though.

### Better Understanding of the Requirements

Having a good understanding of the project at the start was a bit challenging
but with time, knowing the best solution to a new problem has become easier.

### Annoyed

Being annoyed about fixing my code and rewriting it.

### Dealing with Promises

Splitting these up to small parts made it easier.

### Objects

Using objects where possible allows more room to customize as new visual features
are added in such as animations.

# Conclusion

Hopefully will fix the grammar for this some day.
